# FUTURE_DS_01

This repository contains my Power BI dashboard built for Task 1 of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship. Using the Superstore sales dataset, I created an interactive report that helps quickly understand overall business performance through key KPIs and drill-down visuals. The dashboard highlights Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, and Total Customers, along with a monthly sales trend, top-selling products, and sales breakdown by category and region, supported by slicers to explore insights across Region, Category, and Segment.

To view the project, download the .pbix file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop, then use the slicers to interact with the visuals. A quick walkthrough video has been attached for your convinience.
